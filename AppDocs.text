This is where I will be putting the documentation of my application 

Query Assist is an easy to use and user friendly web-bassed application which helps Web Developers 
tackle the frustration that comes with making your website and or web application responsive to different screen sizes. Our application will reduce 
the the time spent on trying to figure out the "perfect" media queries by providing you with the best custom queries that will best suite your website/application.

I have created two text areas that will both be recieving different
types of inputs from the user (HTML/CSS).
